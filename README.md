# Circulr

A cross-platform mobile application that helps users reduce waste and promote reuse.

### Download the app on mobile:

iOS: https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/circulr-reuse/id1605639496

Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.circulrshop.circulr

### How the app works:

Consumers simply return rinsed packaging from the brands we work with to a Circulr bin, and track their return through the Circulr app to receive a deposit or reward. Once the packaging is dropped off Circulr collects it, washes it, and ships it back to the brand to be refilled and put back on store shelves.
